        <h3>Some of my favorite things include...</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>Animals</summary>
            I'm a huge animal lover, and always have been. As a kid I went through obsessions with dogs, fennec foxes,
            ferrets, otters, and more. My current favorite animals are hamsters, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits.
            I'm a big fan of rodents, if you can't tell.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Pokemon</summary>
            I've been a fan of Pokemon since I first started watching my older brother play SoulSilver. For Christmas
            one year, he gave me his copy of the game, and my parents got me HeartGold as well. This led to years of
            collecting games, and any merch I could get my tiny hands on. I've since gotten rid of my collection, but
            I'm still waiting desparately for Scarlet and Violet to come out.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Tattoos</summary>
            Before coming to CodeStack, my plan was to become a tattoo artist. My uncle is an artist, and all my family
            has their pieces done by him. I've always wanted tattoos, and when I finally made the connection that I
            could also do it for a living, I was all up for it. However, Tony provided a great opportunity when he told
            me about CodeStack, and I don't regret my decision to persue this instead.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Alana</summary>
            Alana is the name of my girlfriend. We've been together for over three years, after she asked me out during
            our mutual friends' quinceanera. Earlier this year I moved in with her, so you may see her in the background
            of my zoom from time to time. She means the world to me, and I can't imagine life without her. I'm gonna
            marry this girl someday.
